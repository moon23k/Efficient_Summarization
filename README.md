## CPT
The repo title **CPT** refers to a **Chatbot with Pre-Trained Models**. As the name suggests, this repo covers a series of experiments to create a chatbot with three pre-trained models. The Pre-Trained models are BERT, GPT2 and BART repectively.
In the course of a conversation, generating the right answers is just as important as figuring out the meaning of the conversation.
